**Assignment requirements:**

Question 1. [2.5 points] Load oil.csv. This file contains years worth of data of the daily
oil price. However, the data is missing for a few days. Make sure that every day contains
a value using any data imputation technique that you learned during the data preparation
week or during the missing values imputation week.

Question 2. [2.5 points] Augment the data in test.csv and train.csv with the oil price.

Question 3. [2.5 points] Note that the training set contains a ‘sales’ column while the test
set does not. Use the training set to train a model of your choice and use that model to
predict which values for sales should be in the test set. You should try training at least 2
models and compare their accuracy later.

Question 4. [2.5 points] Compare your prediction with the prediction found in submis-
sion.csv with 3 different methods:
(a) Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
(b) Mean absolute deviation
(c) Another metric of your choice Compare the three errors. Are they in agreement? Do you
think any of the methods is objectively better than the others in this case?

Note: The data files are too large to upload

All solutions are found in the `tasks.ipynb` file.
